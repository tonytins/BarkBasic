# Bark Basic

Bark Basic (working title) is a BASIC programming language paser. Right now, it is a very simple project that I'll doing in my spare time.

## Background

I've always wanted to write a parser for a programming language, but I had no idea where to start because there are so many ways to write one. Despite writing varies ones in the past, I've never really felt satisfied, so I asked AI. 

Originally, I used ChatGPT and I create a BASIC parser so I could use a template. While it worked, it was a little over-engineered for what I needed. Fast-forward to Deepseek making a splash, I tweaked the system prompt for the Coder version to be as good as NASA and requested the same thing but have it be expandable. Worked on the first try from [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/vPPVHD).
