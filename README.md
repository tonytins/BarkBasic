# Bark Basic

Bark Basic (working title) is a BASIC programming language paser. Right now, it is a very simple project that I'll doing in my spare time.

## Background

I've always wanted to write a parser for a programming language, but I had no idea where to start because there are so many ways to write one. Despite writing varies ones in the past, I've never really felt satisfied. In the past, I had the free version of ChatGPT write me drafts for a few starting points, but those were as buggy as you would expect. So, I decided to give it another whirl using Bing Copilot instead. After a few attempts, I asked it to use my algorithm from [CST.NET](https://github.com/tonytins/cstdotnet) as a reference, and it worked!
